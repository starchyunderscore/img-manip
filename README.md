# img-manip
Simple TUI image manipulator written in python


Current state:

I do not know how to make a terminal application. I am trying to learn.


The plan:

Display preview of original image next to edited on most of the top of the screen (using the screenbuffer?).

On the bottom of the screen, some options:

- f1: invert
- f2: grayscale
- f3: rotate anticlockwise
- f4: rotate clockwise

- f5: crop
- f6: hue adjust
- f10: save (overwrite)
- f8: save (copy)

- f9: open new image (save/discard)
- f10: fullscreen the original image
- f11: fullscreen the edit preview
- f12: quit (save/discard)
